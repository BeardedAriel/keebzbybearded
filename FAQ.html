            <p>• **Shipping Times**: We are a small, single-man company, and as such, we strive to offer the best service we can, but we may require additional time for certain custom orders. Please understand that shipping times may vary.<br>
            • **Taxes & Fees**: As mentioned earlier, sales tax and any applicable duties or import fees are the responsibility of the buyer. These will be calculated at checkout, and the final price will reflect these charges.<br>
            • **Customization**: While we pride ourselves on making custom keyboards, please note that some options may require longer build times due to parts availability or special customization requests.<br>
            • **Order Modifications**: If you need to change an order after placing it, please reach out as soon as possible. We will do our best to accommodate your request before the order is processed.<br><br>
            We appreciate your understanding and support. Thank you for choosing Keebs by Bearded for your custom mechanical keyboard needs!</p>
